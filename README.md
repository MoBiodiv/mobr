# Measurement of Biodiversity in R 

This repository hosts an R package that is actively being developed for 
estimating biodiversity and the components of its change. The key innovations of
this R package over other R packages that also carry out rarefaction (e.g.,
`vegan`, `iNext`) is that `mobr` is focused on 1) making empirical comparisons between 
treatments or gradients, and 2) our framework emphasizes how changes in 
biodiversity are linked to changes in community structure: the SAD, total
abundance, and spatial aggregation. 

The concepts and methods behind this R package are described in three publications.

Please cite `mobr`. Run the following to get the appropriate citation for the version you're using:

```r
citation(package = "mobr")
```

## Installation

```r
install.packages('mobr')
```

Or, install the Github version

```r
install.packages('remotes')
```

Now that `remotes` is installed you can install `mobr` using the following R code:

```r
remotes::install_github('MoBiodiv/mobr')
```

## Examples

The package [vignette](https://github.com/MoBiodiv/mobr/blob/master/vignettes/mobr_intro.pdf)
provides a useful walk-through the package tools, but below is some example code
that uses the two key analyses and related graphics. 

```r
library(mobr)
library(dplyr)

data(tank_comm)
data(tank_plot_attr)
indices <- c('N', 'S', 'S_n', 'S_C', 'S_PIE')
tank_div <- tibble(tank_comm) %>% 
  group_by(group = tank_plot_attr$group) %>% 
  group_modify(~ calc_comm_div(.x, index = indices, effort = 5,
                               extrapolate = TRUE))
plot(tank_div)
tank_mob_in <- make_mob_in(tank_comm, tank_plot_attr, coord_names = c('x', 'y'))
tank_deltaS <- get_delta_stats(tank_mob_in, 'group', ref_level='low',
                             type='discrete', log_scale=TRUE, n_perm = 5)
plot(tank_deltaS, 'b1')
```
